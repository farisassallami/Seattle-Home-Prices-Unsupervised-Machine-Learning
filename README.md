# Seattle-Home-Prices-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
## Business Problem
A real estate company in Seattle wants to improve price predictions for their clients by understanding the local housing market better. They have a dataset of Seattle housing prices and want to cluster similar houses using K-means. They need to determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow plot and Silhouette score to tailor their pricing strategies effectively.

## Business Objectives
This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to perform analysis on the Seattle Housing Prices dataset. It includes the implementation of K-means clustering, evaluation using Silhouette score, and visualization with an elbow plot.  We aim to,

1. Improve price predictions accuracy.
2. Tailor pricing strategies based on market segments.
3. Enhance client satisfaction.
4. Gain insights into the housing market.
5. Gain a competitive edge in the industry.
